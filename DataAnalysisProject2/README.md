Implement EM for maximum likelihood estimation and cluster the text data provided in the data.mat le
you downloaded. You can nd detailed description about the data in the homework2.m le Observe the
result and compare them with the provided true clusters each document belongs to. Report the evaluation
(e.g. accuracy) of your implementation.
Hint: We already did the word counting for you, so the data le only contains a count matrix like the
one shown above. Set the number of clusters nc = 4. You will need to initialize the parameters. Try
several dierent random initial values for the probability of a word being Wj in topic c, jc. Make sure you
normalized it. Make sure that you should not use the true cluster information during your learning phase.
(If you refer to the truth value in your code, you will receive no credit.)Implement EM for maximum likelihood estimation and cluster the text data provided in the data.mat le
